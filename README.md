# Task 8: String Reversal Program

## Objective
Develop a C program that reads a string from the user and then prints the reverse of the string. The program should handle strings of varying lengths and should consider the string termination character `\0`.

## Requirements
- The program must be written in C.
- Prompt the user to enter a string.
- Reverse the input string and display the result.
- Ensure the reversed string is correctly terminated with a `\0` character.
- Handle strings of varying lengths, including the empty string.

## Example Input/Output

Enter a string: hello <br />
Reversed: olleh <br />

Enter a string: 12345 <br />
Reversed: 54321 <br />

## Submission Guidelines
- Name your C source file as `string_reversal.c`.
- Your code should be well-commented, explaining the logic behind reversing the string.
- Push your program to your assigned GitHub repository before the deadline.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Correctness: The program correctly reverses the input string and handles edge cases.
- Code Quality: The code is clean, efficient, and well-commented.
- Adherence to the submission guidelines.
